Priority Pilot for Tracking Business Obligations
================================================
### Introduction ###

"Priority Pilot" is a simple and efficient task management application that helps users organize their obligations. 
It offers features like creating new obligations with titles, descriptions, priorities, and due dates and times. 
Users can manage obligations by editing and deleting them. "Priority pilot" was developed as a practical part of my thesis entitled "Development of web-oriented applications based on components" at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in East Sarajevo.

### App Features ###

* Obligation Creation: Easily create new obligations with titles, descriptions, priorities, due dates and times.
* Obligation Management: Modify and remove obligations to enhance task organization efficiency.
* User Interface: Dashboard with a simple and user-friendly design focused on excellent user experience (UX).

### Technologies Used ###

* Front-end: Built using React with JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive user interface.
* Back-end: Developed with the Spring Boot framework in Java to ensure robust server-side operations.
* Database: Utilizes PostgreSQL to store and manage application data efficiently.

### Technical Specification ###
* RESTful API: Implemented using Spring Web MVC for handling HTTP requests and responses on back-end. Front-end uses Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests to the backend endpoints.
* Database:
  * Database Management System: Utilizes PostgreSQL to persist data related to obligations.
  * Integration: Spring Data JPA is used for seamless integration with the database, providing object-relational mapping (ORM).
* Dependency Injection: Employs Spring Framework's dependency injection for managing components and services within the application.
